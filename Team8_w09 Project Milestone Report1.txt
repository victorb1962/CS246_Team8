• Have all Activities and User-Interfaces identified and developed with tweaking and testing remaining?
• Identify the design of the app – fonts, colors, images, the theme to use

We have the activities and user interfaces identified.
We have built a common library of the theme, fonts, colors, images, and strings to be used.
We have agreed on the layout and final product of the team application.

The authentication process has been completed using Google's Firebase Authentication.
We are still working out the database type to be used. It will not be cloud-based as we had initially planned but instead be stored locally since it is personalized data.
