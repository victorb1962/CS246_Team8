## Generation

When comments are finalized, follow these steps to automatically generate the JavaDoc:

1. Go to **Tools** -> **Generate JavaDoc…**

2. In **Other command line arguments** enter the path to the android.jar as the bootclasspath, e.g: 

    ```-bootclasspath /Users/YourUserName/Library/Android/sdk/platforms/android-22/android.jar```

3. Configure any additional settings specific to the documentation.

4. Documents will be saved in the **Output directory**, choose a folder and click **Ok**.


## Visualization

1. Go to the output directory you defined when generating the docs.

2. Open "index.html" with any browser.
